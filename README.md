# HealthcareDataCleaning_202401100400164

Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning healthcare data to improve disease prediction accuracy by addressing missing, inconsistent, and noisy data. It uses techniques such as imputation of missing values and encoding of categorical data to prepare the dataset for machine learning models. The code also includes visualizations to better understand the cleaned dataset.

Steps Covered in the Code
Data Cleaning:

Imputation of missing numerical values with the median.
Imputation of missing categorical values with the most frequent value.
Data Encoding:

Categorical columns like symptoms are encoded using LabelEncoder to make them machine-readable.
Visualizations:

Histograms, bar plots, box plots, and pair plots to explore data distributions and relationships between features.
